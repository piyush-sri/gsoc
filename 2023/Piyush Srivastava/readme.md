# About Me
Hello! My name is Piyush Srivastava and I am based in UP, India. As a beginner open-source contributor, I am passionate about making meaningful contributions to
open-source projects. I am particularly interested in participating in GSoC with Wagtail because I believe it will provide me with an opportunity to hone my
skills, gain valuable experience, and make a significant impact on a real-world project.

# Contributions
I have already participated in Hacktoberfest and contributed to more than four open-source projects with coding and documentation.
Through this experience, I better understood how open-source communities work and the importance of collaborating with others to achieve a common goal.

#End Goal
I am excited to take my knowledge and experience to the next level by participating in GSoC with Wagtail.
My skills and enthusiasm for open source will enable me to make a valuable contribution to the project.
